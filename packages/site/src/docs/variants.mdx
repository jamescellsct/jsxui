# Variants

Each component has a set of props that controls the behavior of the component. Variants are the reusuable configurations of props that can be used to create different implementations of components.

```jsx
<Circle
  radius={[
    ['initial', 20],
    ['press', 10],
  ]}
/>
```

```jsx
<Circle radius={[20, ['press', 10]]} />
```

Initial states are the default values for the component:

```jsx
<Circle radius={20} />
```

Use variants to create different states of a component:

```jsx
<Circle radius={{ initial: 20, press: 10 }} />
```

Or with keyframes:

```jsx
<Circle radius={[20, 10]} />
```
