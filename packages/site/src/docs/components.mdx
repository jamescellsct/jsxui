# Components

Components are made up of a name, a type, and a list of properties. They fall into two categories:

## Base components

Base components are the most basic building blocks of the system. They are the building blocks of the system, and are the building blocks of the system.

## Composite components

Compositie components are compositions of base components. This is where the compiler shines and is able to flatten the tree of components into a base components.
