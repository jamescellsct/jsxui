# Draggable

Drag and drop is essential for many applications. It offers a way to move an object from one place to another. This is done by dragging the object with the pointer and releasing it at the new location. This is a feature seen in many operating system applications, such as the Finder, Safari, and many other applications.

In simple usecases, you can use the draggable() method to make an element draggable.

```jsx
<Circle draggable />
```

In more complex cases, you can use the `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` helpers to make an element draggable and droppable.

```jsx
import { useDroppable } from 'jsxui'

function App() {
  const [drag, drop] = useDroppable()
  return (
    <Stack onDrop={(id) => console.log(`${id} dropped`)}>
      <Circle id="circle" draggable />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```
