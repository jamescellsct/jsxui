# Compiler

At the core of JSXUI is the compiler. The compiler takes your Design System and allows you to build flexible cross-platform components optimized for your tech stack.

## Design System Graph

Design Systems at their core are a graph of tokens. These tokens are the building blocks of your Design System. They are simple atomic untis that can be used to build up complex components which are themselves tokens. The compiler analyzes this graph throughout your entire project providing a rich developer experience in turn allowing you to more easily create great user experiences.

## Analytics

Because your Design System is a graph, the compiler can provide you with a lot of information about how your Design System is used throughout a project.

```bash
jsxui analyze
```

This will output where your theme is being used along with how
