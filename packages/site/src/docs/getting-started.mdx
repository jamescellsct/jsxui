# Getting Started

JSXUI encourages best practices for writing performant and flexible components that can adapt to any platform. It does this by using a configurable build system that generates platform specific code using a powerful compiler.

## Setup

To get started we will pull down the proper libraries and install them. Please note, JSXUI currently depends on TypeScript and only works with React. In the future we hope to support other frameworks as well.

In your root directory run:

```bash
yarn create jsxui
```

This will bootstrap your JSXUI project and add the proper dependnecies to your package.json and tsconfig.json files.

## Manual Setup

If you would rather not use the command line, you can manually add the following packages to your `package.json`:

```bash
yarn add jsxui react
```

Next create a jsxui.config.js file in your project root:

```bash
touch jsxui.config.js
```

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a required dependnecy of JSXUI. Type analysis is used to provide rich autocompletion and autogenerated types specific to your configuration. While this most likely will work with JavaScript projects, the primary focus is on compatibility with TypeScript. Please file an issue if you would like to discuss adding support.

## Your First Project

JSXUI is made to be as simple as possible for creating cross-platform components. To get started, we'll create a new project:

// TODO: prompt for target if not provided as well as detect if a package.json is in the same working directory

```bash
jsxui init --target=react-dom
```

We'll be targeting the web in this simple project to start so we'll pass `react-dom` as the target platform.

### Adding to an active project

If you're not creating a brand new project, see the additional guides below:

## Writing A Component

// TODO: prompt for name if not provided for a smooth experience

We'll start by creating a new component:

```bash
jsxui new component --name=Button
```

A new component should now be added at `components/Button.tsx`. This is based on the default configuration and can be set in your `jsxui.config.ts` file.

Notice that since this was our first component, the tool did some other setup. We also added a `components` directory to our project along with an `index.ts` file that exports the component.

JSXUI will help you to automatically add components, hooks, utilities and their exports to your project as we'll see in future guides.
