# Getting Started

## Setup

In your root directory run:

```bash
yarn create jsxui-library
```

This will bootstrap your JSXUI project and add the proper dependnecies to your package.json and tsconfig.json files.

## Manual Setup

If you would rather not use the command line, you can manually add the following packages to your `package.json`:

```bash
yarn add jsxui react
```

Next create a jsxui.config.js file in your project root:

```bash
touch jsxui.config.js
```

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a required dependnecy of JSXUI. Type analysis is used to provide rich autocompletion and autogenerated types specific to your configuration.

## Your First Project

JSXUI is made to be as simple as possible for creating cross-platform components. To get started, we'll create a new project:

```bash
jsxui init --target=react-dom
```

We'll be targeting the web in this simple project to start so we pass `react-dom` as the target platform.

### Adding to an active project

If you're not creating a brand new project, see the additional guides below:

## Writing Your First Component

We'll start by creating a new component:

```bash
jsxui new component --name=Button
```

A new component should now be added at `components/Button.tsx`. This is based on the default configuration and can be set in your `jsxui.config.js` file.

Notice that since this was our first component, the tool did some other setup. We also added a `components` directory to our project along with an `index.ts` export.
