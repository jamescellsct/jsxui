# Props

Props are a fundamental and simple concept in JSX. We can use props to pass data through our tree of components eventually getting to a [leaf component](#1). In JSXUI, props are augmented with additional functionality to make working with systems easier and performant.

## Theming

## Variants

Variants are a powerful concept in JSXUI. Variants are a way to define a set of props that can be used to render a component. For example, we can define a `Button` component with a `primary` variant that has a different background color. Or perhaps we want to define a heading variant for use with a `Text` component.

#1 [Leaf component](#1)

Leaf components are the lowest component in the tree of components and are usually responsible for rendering UI. An example of a leaf component in web is a `<span>` element that renders text content.
