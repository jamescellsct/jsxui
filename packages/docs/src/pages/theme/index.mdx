title: Theme
---

Theme is composed of simple primitive values that are reused throughout a tree of components. While they may be of any value, it is advised to keep these as root values and use `Modifiers`, `States`, and `Overrides` to alias or apply sets of tokens that can be turned on/off.

```jsx
<Theme
  colors={{
    primary: 'papayawhip',
    secondary: 'tomato',
  }}
  fontSizes={{
    small: '16px',
    medium: '20px',
    large: '24px',
  }}
  fontWeights={{
    light: '300',
    medium: '400',
    bold: '700',
  }}
>
  ...
</Theme>
```
